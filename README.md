# Omdena_Project

The problem :-
Each year, disasters around the world kill nearly 100,000 and affect or displace 200 million people. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally ‘missing’ from any map and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts. 

There is a need for map data that revolutionizes disaster management, reduces risks, contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and helps humanitarian organizations that are trying to meet the needs of vulnerable people.

Our Partner – HOT develops open source apps and tools for collaborative mapping and geospatial data collection. Their tools are free for all to use and leveraged by partners such as Red Cross societies, Médecins Sans Frontières, UN agencies and programmes, government agencies, and local NGOs and communities.

 

The project goals:-
The project goal is to achieve an open-source AI-assisted mapping tool where AI models* are created and trained by end users in a live environment. Training datasets would be built and placed on defined locations, AI models are then created and evaluated (precision/recall) and those models will be used to detect features and push them into OpenStreetMap. End users will be able to select the Open Aerial Mapimagery OAM and define a small region of the area of interest and grab the labels (with ability to modify).

* AI models in this context are features extraction (binary semantic segmentation or others) on open aerial imagery (raster) based on the training dataset & its labels.

This repo consists of a CNN Model for segmentation purpose.
